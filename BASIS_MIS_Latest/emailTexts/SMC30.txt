Your current coverage expires within 45 days. In 30 days, BASIS will e-mail you an invoice for a 12-month software maintenance renewal. This invoice will reflect any applicable discount(s).

BASIS urges you to renew the SAM Plan coverage before it expires. If you allow this maintenance coverage to expire and decide later to purchase SAM coverage, you must pay for the total maintenance coverage during the expired period (accrued daily) plus a reinstatement fee. This reinstatement fee, charged for each license listed above, is 12% of the list price of each new license. 

Renewing software maintenance is a guarantee of:
  + free product upgrades
  + free technical support (up to 5 incidents per license per year)
  + free license resets
  + no reinstatement fees
  + price advantages for additional users
  + discounts on BASIS training

For more information, please contact BASIS Sales via e-mail at sales@basis.cloud or by phone at 1.505.938.6120 (U.S.) or +1.505.338.4188 (International). 

Thank you for your continued use of BASIS products.
