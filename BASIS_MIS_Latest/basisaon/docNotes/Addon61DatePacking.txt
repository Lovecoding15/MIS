The procedures described in this document have been designed and implemented 
by AddonSoftware and have received limited testing by the AddonSoftware staff. 
They have been successfully performed by partners who have had to address this 
problem prior to 2006. However, AddonSoftware can not guarantee that they will 
work under all circumstances or in all situations and partners using these 
procedures should test the resulting software as thoroughly as possible prior 
to introducing it to a production environment.



Section 1 - Introduction

AddonSoftware Version 6.x was originally released in May, 1996. The software 
as released was Y2K compliant and correctly processed dates through the year 2009. 
Many of those systems continue to be used and are beginning to bump up against the 
2009 limit. This document is intended to provide you with a solution for modifying 
v6.x to handle dates beyond 2009.


Section 2 - AddonSoftware Version 6.x

Standard AddonSoftware Version 6.x can be modified to process dates beyond 2009 using 
a simple search and replacement of the literals used by the date functions in the programs. 
Changes are required to two functions. In this example, the upper limit is being moved from 
2009 to 2019 and the change is bolded and highlighted.

Change line 8130 (function FNYY_YY21$) from:

8130 LET Q3$=" A123456789ABCDEFGHIJ",Q1$(1,1)=Q3$(POS(Q1$(1,1)=" 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJ"))

to:

8130 LET Q3$=" AB23456789ABCDEFGHIJ",Q1$(1,1)=Q3$(POS(Q1$(1,1)=" 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJ"))

and again to:

8130 LET Q3$=" ABCDE56789ABCDEFGHIJ",Q1$(1,1)=Q3$(POS(Q1$(1,1)=" 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJ"))

And change line 8180 (function FNYY_YEAR) from:

8180 LET Q=NUM(FNYY21_YY$(Q1$)); IF Q<10 THEN LET Q=Q+100

to:

8180 LET Q=NUM(FNYY21_YY$(Q1$)); IF Q<20 THEN LET Q=Q+100

and again to:

8180 LET Q=NUM(FNYY21_YY$(Q1$)); IF Q<50 THEN LET Q=Q+100


No conversions of existing data are required. If you would prefer to move the limit out to 
2029 or beyond, simply continue replacing digits with letters in line 8130 and change the 
test in line 8180 from 20 to 30 (or more).

Section 3 - GENERAL Report Writer

The date handling functions contained in the GENERAL Report Writer Data Dictionary are 
capable of dates beyond 2009. No changes are required.

Section 4 - The BASIS ODBC Driver

The BASIS ODBC driver has not been tested with these changes. Because the date functions 
are hardcoded into the driver by BASIS the possibility exists that dates beyond 2009 may 
not be imported or displayed correctly.

Please let us know if you encounter problems with these dates and the ODBC driver. We will 
try and work with you and BASIS (if necessary) to resolve the problems.
